# Answers for Questions

### Q5a
**Question:** Choose __one__ comparison scenario and create at least three alternative designs that would allow this comparison.

-
**Answer:** 

- put your sketches in folder [designStudio/](designStudio/)

- In the class design studio, I worked with other people and we created several alternative designs. One is the "bars from period one and period two right next to each other" idea; instead of what I have, it would consist of static bars of the average across all periods placed right besides moving bars that change depending on selection. Having individual bars of period one and period two next each other would yield a design, and having two separate graphs (one static and one moving) would yield a variation. I went with something else; lightly faded bars that would darken based on bars that would eventually be placed over them. 

### Q5b
**Question:** Implement one design in your visualization for **PrioVis** and explain why you have chosen this design.

-
**Answer:**  

- From above: "I went with something else; lightly faded bars that would darken based on bars that would eventually be placed over them." I figured that there would be a lot of people implementing a "shape of all aggregates" sort of thing for the barchart where a plain-colored, static barchart is superimposed upon a moving, normal-looking barchart. Decided to do something a little different from it, so I visualized the votes by day quite literally stacking on top of one another, on top of the previous counts. What ends up being shown is a nice visualization of the proportional representation of each issue in comparison to one another, across different periods of time.

Moreover, when you yield a small brush and just go straight from the beginning of the year to the end (or the other way around), you can see, in real-time, all the priorities stack on top of each other. Pretty cool.

### Q5c
**Question:** As a very minimal case study submit a screenshot of an interesting pattern which you have found with your method and briefly describe the pattern.

-
**Answer:**

- More people are worried about climate change from December to February. Perhaps because of the cold?
