#PSET 3 QUESTION RESPONSES

### Question 3a: the body is the HTML element that contains everything; it's the divs with class of rows that represents the interactive area. The divs with rows are actually subdivided into smaller divs of various column sizes (bootstrap), and that's where the individual visualizations are located. 

### Question 3b: it's a rectangle, of class "extent". That's the brushed, grayed rectangle on the screen. OR I suppose we could be talking about the g class="brush"...

### Question 3c: just stuff like the edges. I'm assuming you're talking about the <g class="resize e">
