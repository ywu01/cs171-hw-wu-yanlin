RESPONSES TO SEVERAL QUESTIONS
Y. KIT WU

1.1: HTML doesn't show the D3 functions that produce each individual HTML element. The DOM inspector is rather useful since you can use the console within. 

1.2: Original data was stored in the JSON file

2.1: Some, but not all. Aggregation cannot be filtered the same way.

3.1: There's probably a way, but I don't think I used that way.

4.1: The new attribute holds GDP/Population/LE info for those particular years, as well as export/import stuff

5.1: SVG is more visual, I suppose. HTML can't produce shapes on that level

7.1 Viz is appropriate to show and explore, but not for fast calculations
7.2 Limitations: people can't interact with the info, but with viz they can
7.3 LImits of viz: you can't do EVERYTHING with it
7.4 Semantics: to distinguish between data types, and to organize them
7.5 
7.6 Color, shape, size, etc. A lot of stuff
7.7 Less than 7.6
