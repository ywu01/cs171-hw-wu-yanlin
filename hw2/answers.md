# Homework Two: Answer Responses

QUESTION 0.1: It's the x and y positions; it's the horizontal and vertical positions. That sounds pretty self-explanatory, as it determines where the nodes show up. 

QUESTION 0.2: intensity/hue, saturation/luminance, area, depth, volume. 

QUESTION 0.3: intensity/hue are correlated, and I suppose saturation and luminance are deptendent on intensity + hue. Area/depth/volume seem to be pretty independent, but volume might be dependent on area as it is basically area in a 3-d form. 

QUESTION 1.1: Equal spacing: it's far more readable, and in my case, it's listed alphabetically. Makes searching for specific countries a lot easier, but it doesn't show any information about those countries. 

Position based on population: it's not as readable, but it show some info about the countries via. position. 

QUESTION 1.2: quantitative, because it says so in the textbook, but also because it makes sense to position things on a plot where the x and y positions represent certain numeric values. Categorical data, for example, would be a bad fit as it doesn't really do anything meaningful with the quantitative aspect of a scatterplot position and as such could potentially confuse people who assume that there IS some connection. 

QUESTION 2.1: The D3 layout has more functionalities as specified in https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Pie-Layout, but I assume the tradeoff for that functionality is...run time? 

QUESTION 3.1: reducing visual complexity...hmm. I suppose one other method would be to eliminate the links in the background and only show the ones relevant to a country when that country's node is clicked/hovered upon. Another is to separately display the country's name, in text, in the middle of the circle (or anywhere else, preferably in a clear space). Another one is to show only some nodes at once, and not every single one of them.
